  "datalayer-details-help": "<h2>What is datalayer?</h2> \n The datalayer is a JavaScript object that contains variables and values that can be used to transmit relevant information through tags configured in GTM. For example, when a user makes a purchase on a website, information about that transaction can be sent to the datalayer, such as the transaction ID, total purchase amount, purchased products, etc. GTM tags can then use this information stored in the datalayer to track events, such as sales conversions, and send data to analytics tools like Google Analytics or other third-party tracking platforms. \n <h2>What is datalayer declaration?</h2> refers to the process of defining and structuring a datalayer on a website. This involves creating a JavaScript object that will contain the variables and values necessary to transmit specific information about events and actions on the website. In the context of Google Tag Manager (GTM), a datalayer declaration is essential for establishing a consistent and organized structure for data collection. By declaring a datalayer, variables to store important information are defined, such as transaction information on an e-commerce site, button click events, form submissions, etc. \n <h2>What is datalayer push?</h2> \n refers to the action of adding data to the datalayer on a website using JavaScript. When a datalayer push is performed, specific variables and values are inserted into the datalayer to transmit information about events or actions occurring on the website. In the context of Google Tag Manager (GTM) and other online analytics and tracking tools, datalayer push is a way to send structured data from the website to the datalayer for use by tags configured in GTM. \n <h2>What is datalayer ecommerce?</h2> \n is a data structure specifically designed to collect information related to transactions and ecommerce events on a website. This structure is commonly used in conjunction with analytics and tracking tools like Google Tag Manager (GTM) and Google Analytics to track and analyze user behavior during the online purchasing process. The ecommerce datalayer typically includes variables and values that capture important details about transactions, such as the transaction ID, total purchase amount, purchased products, currency used, product category, quantity of products purchased, etc. This data is structured in a way that is understandable and uses a specific syntax so that it can be easily interpreted by analytics tools.",
  "datalayer-variables-help":"<h2>What are the variables of a datalayer?</h2> \n Variables are key elements that store specific data within the datalayer. Variables can contain a variety of data types, such as text strings, numbers, objects, or arrays, and are used to convey relevant information about events and actions occurring on a website. Datalayer variables can be configured in various ways to capture specific data that is important for the analysis and tracking of user behavior on the website. Some common examples of datalayer variables include: \n <h3>Event variables:</h3> Capture information about specific events occurring on the website, such as button clicks, form submissions, page views, etc. \n <h3>Transaction variables:</h3> \n Store details about transactions made on an e-commerce website, such as transaction ID, total purchase amount, purchased products, currency used, etc. \n <h3>Custom variables:</h3>\n Contain customized data that is relevant to the business or website analysis, such as user identifiers, demographic information, specific conversion values, etc \n <h3>Page variables:</h3> Capture information about the current page being viewed by the user, such as page title, URL, page category, etc. \n These variables can then be used in Google Tag Manager (GTM) to configure tags, triggers, and custom variables that enable advanced tracking and analysis of user behavior on the website.",
  "datalayer-event-details-help":"<h2>What is the difference between Universal Analitycs and Google Analitycs 4? </h2> \n <h3>Universal Analytics (UA)</h3> :In UA, the structure of the datalayer and how variables are added largely depends on the specific implementation that has been done. In general, variables are added to the datalayer using custom functions or JavaScript code that captures relevant data and transmits it to the datalayer in the format required by UA. Ecommerce variables in UA can be configured using UA-specific syntax to convey information about transactions and purchased products to the datalayer. \n <h3>Google Analytics 4 (GA4):</h3> GA4 introduces a more structured and flexible approach to data management, including ecommerce variables, through the specification of events and predefined parameters.In GA4, variables can be added to the datalayer using predefined events and parameters provided by GA4, such as purchase, item_id, item_name, value, currency, etc. These events and parameters are used to convey information about ecommerce transactions to the GA4 datalayer in a more standardized and analytics platform-compatible manner.Additionally, GA4 allows greater flexibility in customizing events and parameters to suit the specific needs of the website or application, making it easier to add and manage ecommerce variables in the datalayer. \n <h2>What are the ecommerce events? </h2> \n The ecommerce events within the datalayer are specific events used to track and record actions related to transactions and ecommerce activities on a website. These events are used to convey information about key actions, such as making a purchase, viewing products, adding products to the shopping cart, among others, to the datalayer. When an ecommerce action occurs on a website, such as a purchase or viewing a product, a corresponding ecommerce event can be generated containing relevant information about the action taken. This information is added to the datalayer in the form of ecommerce events, which can then be processed by analytics tools, such as Google Analytics, to track detailed ecommerce activities and generate relevant reports and analysis. Some common examples of ecommerce events within the datalayer may include:\n <h3>purchase:</h3> Triggered when a purchase transaction is completed on the website, and includes details such as the transaction ID, total purchase amount, purchased products, etc.\n <h3>add_to_cart:</h3> Triggered when a user adds a product to the shopping cart, and includes details such as the product ID, product name, quantity added, etc.\n <h3>remove_from_cart:</h3> Triggered when a user removes a product from the shopping cart, and includes details such as the product ID, product name, quantity removed, etc.\n <h3>view_item:</h3> Triggered when a user views the details of a specific product, and includes details such as the product ID, product name, category, etc. These ecommerce events enable detailed tracking of ecommerce-related activities on a website, providing valuable insights into user behavior and facilitating the optimization of the online shopping experience."
